    ## Caching is both important to reduce the load and bandwidth of the server, as
    ## well as reduce the load time for the user. The site loads fastest if tiles can be
    ## taken from the users browser cache and no round trip through the internet is needed.
    ## With minutely or hourly updates, however there is a trade-off between cacheability
    ## and freshness. As one can't predict the future, these are only heuristics, that
    ## need tuning.
    ## If there is a known update schedule such as only using weekly planet dumps to update the db,
    ## this can also be taken into account through the constant PLANET_INTERVAL in render_config.h
    ## but requires a recompile of mod_tile
    ##

    ## that apply if the config settings are left out. The defaults are more conservative
